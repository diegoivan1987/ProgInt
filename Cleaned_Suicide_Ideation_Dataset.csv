just got in a car accident and i wish it had been worse and that i had gotten fatally injured when i was driving sometimes i imagine just crashing into something and dying i have had some close calls recently with other drivers and i often think afterward that i wish they had ended up hitting me i dont know why i feel like this ive been taking sertraline the generic version of zoloft which has stopped me from feeling horrible on a normal day to day basis but whenever something out of the ordinary happens like this car accident or i mess something up its like i had never taken the medsi feel like i both want to and dont want to die these last couple of years have been horrible for me but i still have dreams and want to do things before i started taking the sertraline i was actively planning my death but now its like i feel half wanting to keep going and half wanting to die before my life moves forward too much this car accident is going to cost me and my family a lot of money and its all my fault maybe they would have gotten some compensation if i had died if i wasnt around anymore they would be sad but i also wouldnt be able to disappoint them and cost them more than they can afford anymorei ama terrible daughter,1

why is mankind afraid of death lately i am asking myself more often and often why do we fear death nowdays back in the middle ages for example of course you fear getting in hell and stupid shit like that but today even if it is completly painless why would you struggle to just end it all i myself am not suicidal i would say even if i think about it more than often to just quit go the pussy but easy way why should i struggle with life instead of going the easy route personally i think its because mankind fears the unkown we dont know whats after death because none really came back from actual death and reported about it like actual clinical dead but is is really the only reason like i know i am not going to kill myself yet and it probably stays that way because i am just too much of a pussy to be a pussy if you get what i mean ,1
